## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:
The purpose of the analysis was to look at trends and key data points from a data set of NYC CitiBike usage in August to determine the possibility of success with a similar business model in Des Moines. We analyzed usage by gender, duration, day of the week, type of consumer, and location as the main factors that could provide a better visual analysis regarding the business model.

### Checkout Times: 
This visualization shows the number of checked out bikes on the y-axis and 'tripduration' (by minutes) on the x-axis all categorized by 'tripduration' (by hours).
There is also a filter option for hours on the right panel. 
5 hours is what seems to be the most common checkout times for riders.

### Checkout Times by Gender:
This next visualization is an extension of the previous. Using the same parameters: total number of checked out bikes, and tripduration (by minutes), we then factored in gender. The graph shows that males make up the majority of the bikes that are checked out.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour:
The graph below shows the total number of trips by weekday and hour. The more trips that are accounted for the deeper the color is shown. From this, we can conclude the main day of the week for usage is Thursdays and that the highest demand times on the weekdays are the hours of 6:00 - 9:00am and in the evening hours between 5:00 - 7:00pm. Overall, the weekend hours remain steady throughout the hours of 10:00am - 6:00pm.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour by Gender:
As a continuation of the prior graph, this collection of 3 graphs shows the usage of Trips by Weekday per Hour categorized by gender. What we see in these graphs supports the visualization of the checkout times by gender that the usage is male dominated. The male section of the graphs is the most densely colored showing that is a greater number of users.

### Type of User - Trips by Weekday
In this graph, usage of trips by weekday is categorized by the type of user between 'Subscriber' and 'Customer'. From our graph, we can see that subscribers have the highest amounts of utilization.

## Summary:
After a thorough review of our visualizations, several conclusions have become apparent. First, weekday CitiBike usage is most popular during commute hours, 6:00 - 9:00am and 5:00 - 7:00pm with Thursdays ringing in as the day of the week with the most usage. Weekends are more than likely leisure riders as the data shows steady usage throughout each weekend day. Additionally, we have learned that males are the more active CitiBike renters. 

While the data that we have gathered provides a lot of useful information for the next business venture, there are a couple of additional graphs I would suggest in order to get a clearer picture. The first one I would like to take a look at might be the contract of usage in the month of August and a Winter month such as December. It's possible that rentals decrease significantly in the Winter months and that could be a significant factor for the business. Additionally, it could be beneficial to have a heat map showing the distance users are traveling from the bike locations. This could provide a better picture for the new business venture in deciding where to open the rental space.
